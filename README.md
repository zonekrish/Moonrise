# Moonrise
This is a simple, sort-of accurate program used to predict moonrise using the time of last moonrise and the distance from the moon to Earth.

This program is purposefully simple and provides no protection for bad inputs. This is just a piece of a larger program

Check out notes.pdf to gain more insight into the physics.
